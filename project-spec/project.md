# Project

## Overview

- **Name**: copilot-agent-modes
- **One-liner**: Reusable, project-independent agent modes, guardrails, and skills for GitHub Copilot — copy into your repo, bootstrap, start building.

## Goals

- Provide structured Copilot workflows (think → explore → architect → execute → debug → document) that work out of the box.
- Customize per project via `/bootstrap` and `project-spec/` — everything else is reusable across repos.
- Portable across VS Code, Copilot CLI, and Copilot coding agent where the underlying primitives support it.
- Keep the template small enough that a new user can understand the full structure in under 10 minutes.

## Non-goals

- Not a VS Code extension or Copilot plugin — no runtime code, no build step.
- Not a framework — adopters copy files, they don't install a dependency.
- Not a replacement for project-specific CI, linting, or testing — those belong in the adopting repo.
- Not an opinionated tech-stack template — the template is stack-agnostic; stack context comes from `project-spec/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Markdown (YAML frontmatter)
- **Frameworks**: None — this is a file template, not a runtime
- **Hosting/Cloud**: N/A — files live in the adopting repo
- **CI/CD**: N/A — no build or deploy pipeline for the template itself

## Users

- Developers using GitHub Copilot in VS Code (primary)
- Developers using Copilot CLI or Copilot coding agent (secondary — skills and instructions are portable; agents and prompts are VS Code-specific)

## Customization layers

The template provides five distinct customization mechanisms, ordered by loading behavior:

| Layer        | Files                             | Loading                            | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guardrails   | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Always-on                          | Constitutional constraints — short, behavioral, every token earns its place    |
| Agents       | `.github/agents/*.agent.md`       | Per-agent selection                | Role identity, handoffs, optional tool scoping                                 |
| Prompts      | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`     | Per-slash-command                  | Ergonomic wrappers that select an agent and provide detailed role instructions |
| Skills       | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`       | Progressive disclosure (on-demand) | Reusable verification procedures and specialized workflows                     |
| Instructions | `.github/instructions/*.md`       | Path-glob matched                  | Project-specific rules generated by `/bootstrap`                               |

`project-spec/` is the data layer — project-specific truth that all layers reference.
