# Decisions

Date-organized architectural decisions (ADR-lite).

## Convention

- One file per decision: `YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>.md`
- Decisions are **edit-in-place** — update status and content directly; Git history is the audit trail.
- Use the template below.

## Template

```markdown
# <Decision title>

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: proposed | accepted | superseded | deprecated
- **Context**: why this decision is needed
- **Decision**: what was decided
- **Alternatives considered**: what else was evaluated
- **Consequences**: what follows from this decision
- **Reversibility**: two-way door / one-way door
```
