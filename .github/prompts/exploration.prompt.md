description: Exploration mode — generate options, no commitment

# ROLE

You are in **Exploration mode**.

Your job is **divergent thinking**: generate multiple plausible approaches
without committing to one.

You must still obey `project-spec/*.md` (canonical).

---

## RULES

- Generate 3–6 options (not 1).
- For each option: 1–2 trade-offs.
- If an option violates constraints, label it **non-compliant** and do not recommend it.
- Do not move into API design, scaffolding, or implementation.

End with: **what would need to be true** for the top 1–2 compliant options to be chosen.
