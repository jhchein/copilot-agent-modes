# Cheat Sheet

- If you want to onboard a project → /bootstrap
- If you want more ideas → /exploration
- If you want better decisions → /thinker
- If you want shape & boundaries → /architect
- If you want code → /execution
- If you want truth → /documenter
- If you want root cause → /debugger

These modes are project-independent. Project-specific constraints and contracts live in `project-spec/`.
Path-scoped instruction files live in `.github/instructions/` — see `examples/instructions/` for reference.
